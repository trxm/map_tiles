### About the Map/Tiles
In this map, I wanted to focus specifically on the city of Tacoma, where I'm from. Therefore, I made sure I minizmie zoom levels of tiles from 11 to 14. The first tile is a simple basemap created in MapBox. I modified the color to a dark gray, make the fonts brighter, and bigger. The second tile is a plain map of the eight historic district, which are mainly located in the downtown area and Ruston Point. The third tile is thematic map of the historic district data placed on top of the basemap. The final tile is a themed map, where I wanted to portray the colors of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, which are mainly red and yellow.
